## <a name="1"></a> Preliminary configuration
Called by running `python install/configure.py` after installing the module. If you are following standard installation scripts, this will start up automatically. Preliminary configuration will set the values for 

1. `base_path`: a `string` of a valid path to the `BCoreData` folder. Upon finishing, this folder will be automatically created along with the relevant sub-folders as specified in [Data Models for BCore](#https://github.com/balajisriram/bcore/blob/master/bcore/docs/1.DataModelForBCore.md). 
2. `mode`: one of `['Server','Client','StandAlone']` and will decide what the specific installation will be used as.
3. `ip_addr`: a string of the current IP address (in IPv4 format). *Currently not changeable*.
4. `detail_config`: a checkbox that will decide if more detailed configuration will be provided after the current form exits

All these details will be saved in `bcore.config` in the standard config path for the installation.
