## <a name="1"></a> Philosophy of data storage in BCore
BCore requires that three separate kinds of data needs to be kept track of:

1. Data that does not change regularly. This includes details about the server, station, animals and assignments. 
2. Data that changes every day, or changes every trial. This includes trial specific information (every trial), information about the number of trials performed by a subject (every day) etc.
3. Data that is of either of the above kind, but cannot be human readable or easily de-serialized as it contains sensitive infomration. Specifically requires password protection *(not yet implemented)*

BCore prefers data that is easily human readable. This means that the data is serialized as JSON files split into a variety of folders.

## <a name="2"></a> What is stored where?

Configuration of the server requires specifying the `$SERVER_BASE_PATH`. Default `$SERVER_BASE_PATH` is identical to `$BASEDIRECTORY` location and is specified by the function `bcore.get_base_directory()`. `$BASEDIRECTORY`>`.bcore` will contain config files about the installation.

### On the server 

- Information about the server is stored in `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`BCoreData`>`ServerData` in the file `db.server_data`. Changes to server data results in data being backed up in `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`BCoreData`>`ServerData`>`backup`.
- Subject specific data will be stored in `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`SubjectData`. `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`SubjectData`>`History` contains `<subject-id>.history` which provides a list of all the parameter changes to a given subject. `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`SubjectData`>`TrialData` contains `<subject-id>.trial_data` which will contain all trial specific data
- Station specific data will be stored in `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`StationData`. `$SERVER_BASE_PATH `>`StationData`>`<station_id>` will contain `<station_id>.calib` file with calibration data for the display, the valves, the runnometers

Upon starting the program,
