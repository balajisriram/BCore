## 1. What is BCore? Who developed it? Why?
BCore was developed by me (Balaji Sriram) starting around 2014. All that time, all my behavior experiments were performed using custom code written in MatLab ([maustrix](https://github.com/balajisriram/maustrix)). That code base was in itself an adaptation of work done with the [Reinagel Lab](http://www.ratrix.org/). BCore wasn't deployed until I moved to Biogen, where Matlab licenses cost an arm, a leg and your first born. **BCore aims to be a python implementation of the earlier MatLab codebase**. Many of the underlying concepts were derived form `maustrix`.
