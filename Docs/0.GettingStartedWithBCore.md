## <a name="1"></a>1. What is BCore? Who developed it? Why?
BCore was developed by me (Balaji Sriram) starting around 2014. All that time, all my behavior experiments were performed using custom code written in MatLab ([maustrix](https://github.com/balajisriram/maustrix)). That code base was in itself an adaptation of work done with the [Reinagel Lab](http://www.ratrix.org/). BCore wasn't deployed until I moved to Biogen, where Matlab licenses cost an arm, a leg and your first born. **BCore aims to be a python implementation of the earlier MatLab codebase**. Many of the underlying concepts were derived form `maustrix`. 
### Goals of BCore
BCore aims to be a Learning Management System to train rodents(primarily), and other organisms on a variety of tasks. While the original purpose was to train rodents on a visual discrimination task, BCore has since been used for auditory discrimination, classical conditioning and other training paradigms that may be of interest. The major requirement in designing BCore is to ensure *minimal user interaction in the day-to-day running of subjects*. This means that the operator is not expected to
